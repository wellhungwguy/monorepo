# dependency-graph-snek-target
A static test repo for DG team's dotcom production Snek tests to target.

## The Rules
1. As Dependency Graph adopts support for more language ecosystems, _add an example manifest here, and update relevant Snek tests_ 🙏
2. Don't push changes to this repo that will effect the existing Snek tests, unless you feel like updating them 🙇
3. I already explained about Fight Club, stop asking 👊
